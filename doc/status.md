# Project Summary

This project implements a networked embedded control system on the W5500-EVB-PICO2 board, targeting real-time photonic device management.  
It uses FreeRTOS, the Pico SDK, and a lightweight Zyre-like messaging layer to handle:

- Incoming mKTL-based TCP commands (WHISPER)
- Asynchronous photodiode telemetry (PUB)
- Dynamic network discovery (ENTER UDP broadcast)

Key hardware devices include external photodiodes (ADS1115), MEMS optical switches (PCAL6416A), and future laser diode drivers (RS-485).

The code emphasizes static memory layout, strict task separation, clear ownership of devices, and lightweight error handling (no runtime exceptions).  
Networking is DHCP-based and automatically recovers after link loss.

All command parsing and dispatch flow through a central `executor_task`, structured for extensibility.  
JSON payloads are parsed via `nlohmann::json`, and keys for device control are defined cleanly in `keys.h`.

Work remains in areas like laser control integration, persistent calibration storage, and broader command coverage.  
Future developers are strongly encouraged to understand the FreeRTOS task structure and device initialization flow before making changes.

## 1. Hardware Overview

The embedded system is based on the **W5500-EVB-PICO2** development board, which combines:
- A **RP2350 microcontroller** (dual Cortex-M33 cores, 264 KB SRAM, 2 MB flash)
- A **WIZnet W5500 Ethernet controller** (SPI-based TCP/IP offload)
- Integrated Ethernet PHY with RJ45 jack.

The board interfaces with several external devices:
- **Photodiodes** connected via an **ADS1115 ADC** (I2C bus).
- **MEMS optical switches** controlled through a **PCAL6416A GPIO expander** (I2C bus).
- **Laser diode drivers** (future, not fully implemented) to be controlled via RS-485 bus.
- **Variable optical attenuators**, driven via a **DACx578 DAC** (SPI or I2C depending on model variant).

The system uses FreeRTOS for task management and standard Pico-SDK libraries for low-level hardware interfaces.

## 2. Design Intent and Philosophy

The project is designed to create a **reliable, networked control system** capable of:

- Responding to **dynamic mKTL-based network commands** over TCP (router/whisper style)
- **Publishing sensor data** (photodiode voltages) asynchronously via Zyre-style PUB sockets
- **Self-discovering** on a local network using **Zyre UDP broadcast ("ENTER")**

### Key design philosophies:
- **Minimal moving parts**: minimal tasks, minimal inter-task coordination complexity.
- **Single Ownership**: Devices (photodiodes, attenuators, switches) are instantiated once, lifetime-managed explicitly.
- **Clear concurrency model**: Only genuinely asynchronous hardware polling (photodiodes) is task-separated.
- **Memory efficiency**: Avoid dynamic allocations where possible; careful use of `string_view`, fixed buffers, and compile-time constants.
- **Future resilience**: Structured around extensibility (e.g., laser diode driver support, additional sensors).
- **FreeRTOS Realism**: Pragmatic use of mutexes where needed, but prefer single-task device ownership when possible.
- **Avoid runtime exceptions**: C++ exceptions are disabled; error handling is done via return codes and checking object states.

## 3. Code Structure and Instructions

### High-Level Architecture:

| Area                  | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `main.cpp`             | Initializes hardware, tasks, queues, and the shared context object |
| `hardware_context.h`   | Defines the shared `HardwareContext` passed to tasks |
| `executor_task.cpp`    | Main command dispatcher: parses inbound mKTL commands and acts on hardware |
| `photodiode_task.cpp`  | Asynchronously polls photodiode voltages and sends updates via the PUB queue |
| `attenuator_task.cpp`  | Receives attenuator set commands |
| `switching_task.cpp`   | Manages MEMS switch router state changes |
| `coms_task.cpp`        | Manages Zyre beaconing, incoming WHISPER handling, and outbound PUB |
| `pico_zyre.cpp`        | Provides lightweight Zyre protocol support (ENTER broadcast, WHISPER receiving, PUB sending) |
| `mems_switching.cpp`   | Abstracts control over MEMSSwitch devices and the MEMSRouter class |
| `keys.h`               | Centralized mKTL key prefixes/suffixes for matching against inbound commands |

### Key libraries:

- **nlohmann/json**: Used for lightweight JSON parsing of inbound mKTL messages
- **Pico SDK**: Base microcontroller support
- **WIZnet ioLibrary Driver**: Raw SPI Ethernet stack for W5500
- **FreeRTOS**: Task scheduling and resource sharing

---

### Explicit Developer Instructions:

- **Review each major task's code (`*_task.cpp`) carefully.**  
  Each is strongly modular and typically owns its domain of hardware or communication.
- **The true command and control flow is in `executor_task.cpp`.**  
  New commands, hardware devices, and features must be added by expanding the dispatcher tables there.
- **Device initialization (photodiodes, attenuators, switches) happens in `main.cpp`.**  
  All shared objects are passed through `HardwareContext`.
- **Zyre network behavior (discovery and messaging) is in `pico_zyre.cpp`.**  
  See `ZyreBeacon::tick()` and `maybe_send_enter()` for dynamic IP broadcasting.
- **Message framing and unframing follows strict multipart framing rules (see `ZyreFramer::decode` and `encode`).**  
  Always validate or extend message parsing at the framer level, not inside tasks.
- **Look carefully at the key naming convention in `keys.h` when matching or dispatching mKTL commands.**  
  Prefixes and suffixes are split for flexibility and clarity.
- **No C++ exceptions are permitted at runtime.**  
  Any new library usage or parsing must use fail-safe, non-throwing patterns.
- **Networking is DHCP dynamic.**  
  If the Ethernet link is dropped and recovered, DHCP automatically restarts.

If reviewing with an AI or static analysis tool:
- Ask it to **trace main task interactions** (command-in queue, pub-out queue)
- Review each task's control loop separately for sleeping and blocking behavior
- Be aware that socket numbers and uses (e.g., WHISPER sockets) are **hardwired constants** in `pico_zyre`
- Recognize that **memory layout is static**; dynamic malloc is avoided wherever possible.

## 4. Outstanding Tasks and Future Work

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Laser Diode Driver Integration** | No current code for RS-485 or laser control tasks. Needs hardware abstraction and basic command parsing. |
| **Full Command Dispatch Coverage** | Only a subset of mKTL command space is wired. Need to extend `executor_task` for things like system status, laser commands, and calibration writes. |
| **EEPROM / Flash Storage** | Settings (e.g., calibration curves) are not persisted across reboots. Would require flash filesystem or raw flash sector management. |
| **Proper Event-Driven Comms** | WHISPER handling is simple now. Scaling to multiple concurrent command sources may require semaphores, improved queue depth management, or request tracking. |
| **Formal Testing** | Unit tests for command parsing, error paths, and hardware failure modes are recommended. No automated tests exist yet. |
| **Power Management** | No explicit low-power or watchdog behavior implemented yet. |
| **Optimization** | Opportunity exists to reduce startup latency and shrink final binary by tuning linker script and trimming unused libraries. |

# ðŸ“‹ Closing

This codebase is designed for clarity, reliability, and growth.  
It is **production capable**, assuming that additional hardware interfaces are finalized and final edge case handling (network loss, hardware faults) are addressed.

**Explicit instruction to future developers**:
- **Read the code**.
- **Understand the task structure** before adding complexity.
- **Preserve the principle** of static, memory-safe embedded C++ design.
