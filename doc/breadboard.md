### Photodiode Monitoring
#### ADS1115 16bit ADC
- Needs Vcc=5 for 50Ohm PD termination
- PD on A0 & A1
- I2C addr: 0x48 (default) or 0x49 (ADDR tied to Vcc)
- Needs 2-channels of LL shifting
- Use I2C0 on pins GP4 (SDA) and GP5 (SCL)
- Kit board has 10K pullups, do we need to get rid of as have pullups on 3.3v side of LL translation?
- Requires 50 Ohm termination resistor on BNC to ADC. (10V -> 5V)
- Should clamp at Vdd+.3 (so lets say .2V above vcc with a shottkey(?) diode)?
- Needs to be set to +-6.144 V

### Variable Attenuation Control

#### DAC7578SPW 8chan DAC driving 3x OPA2991 2 channel OpAmp
- 0 - 4095 (Vref, default=Vcc)
- must not exceed max voltage of variable atten in use
- Kit board has 10K pullups, do we need to get rid of as have pullups on 3.3v side of LL translation?
- Use I2C1 on pins GP2 (SDA) and GP3 (SCL)
- Address (0x4C float, 0x48 GND, 0x4A VCC)
- Use Vcc=3.3
- Use opamp gain to avoid LL shifting
- OpAmp OPA2991 with gain then supplies required current/voltage to attenuator.

Drives: 
- FVOA (resistive, typ~3.5V 80mA @ full atten)
- MSOA (resistive, typ~0.5-3.25V, DNE 4.5V, something like 24-38 mA, datasheet unclear)
- VOAM (capacitive unpol., 0-6V, improved drive with OPA uses )

Resistors @ 28k and 100k or 50k and 100k (VOAM)
